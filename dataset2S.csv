Complicated ;sad
Interesting courses but not very well organized ;sad
Good;happy
Some courses were interesting, some others weren't. No coordination among courses.;sad
It was a mess;sad
It was very challenging ;happy
Truly interesting but in some way quite disorganized;happy
Difficult, need a better organisation and coordination between the courses ;sad
Many projects, few hard-skills, much stress;sad
The semester was overall ok. Some things could be managed better such as the workloads of single courses and examination. The programming teaching was not satisfying.;happy
Chaotic ;sad
Interesting lessons but too little time to study and to acquire a solid knowledge of the subjects;sad
Oddly satisfying but its is required to regard the programming skills;sad
Great but full;happy
I found the first semester to be very challenging and interesting. I acquired a lot of new skills, especially for what concerns programming languages.;happy
Very interesting but at the same time very difficult due to the programming skills required;happy
Personally everything was quite fine, except the dates for exam only in December to which I was not used at all.;happy
The course has far exceeded my expectations. I think it's the right course for me even though it's all very different from my Bachelor's degree, especially study method.;happy
Didn’t like it ;sad
Challenging;happy
Overall quite satisfied with the course but some coordination was missing ;happy
I enjoyed learning new things but sometimes I felt overwheled by the lack of time and the load of work we were assigned;sad
Good;happy
Despite some problems on exams and about organizing the subjects, I found the first semester very interesting both in the subjects and in the topic we studied in the courses ;happy
Sometimes it was a bit chaotic and not well organized but to sum up, the goal of the past  first semester was to learn the basics of programming in python and R and I think I reach it. ;happy
Interesting but badly organized;happy
